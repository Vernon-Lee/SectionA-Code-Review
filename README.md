# Positive aspects of the submission

Hi Student, thanks for the submission!

This was a greate attempt! Your work is well written. You made good use of comments, this increases the readability of your code.
Most of your variables are well named. They give a descriptive and detailed idea of what they are doing and why you have them there.
There are only a few corrections that has to be made for this task to be marked complete.

# Aspects of the submission that could be improved 

On line 11 of your code you printed out the Fibonacci Series of 10 numbers instead of creating a method to do this. 

On line 26 of your code you called a method "reverseString" that you did not create. Please make sure to call the method your created
by inputting the correct method name.

On line 30 of your code the following error message is displayed "Variable 'maxNumber' is already defined in the scope" please make 
sure to take a look at that part of your code.

General
Remove unnessecary white spaces from your code.
As per Java naming rules. please note that we should always use the camelCase convention e.g.
On line 18 of your code the method name is 'reverse_string' instead of 'reverseString'.
